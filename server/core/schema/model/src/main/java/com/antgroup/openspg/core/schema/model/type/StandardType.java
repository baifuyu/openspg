/**
 * Class definition of literal with standard format constraint and semantics. <br>
 *
 * <p>In the real world, some entities have standard format constraints and carry certain semantics.
 * Usually users can understand the meaning of the entity and what format the physical data needs to
 * meet according to entity name. Such as email-address, phone-number, mac-address and so on. <br>
 * Like {@link BasicType}, {@link StandardType} are usually only used as value types of property and
 * cannot be used as the subject of SPO triples.<br>
 * There are also differences between standard types. Some standard types are spreadable, that is,
 * based on the entity of the standard type, you can reversely find which entities point to it, such
 * as mobile phone numbers, email addresses etc., while some standard types only have format
 * constraints and are not semantically communicable, such as timestamp and constellation.
