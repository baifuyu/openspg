/**
 * Configuration of taxon concepts<br>
 * <br>
 *
 * <p>Different from common-sense concept types such as brand, intent; some concept types are
 * dedicated to classifying a certain entity type, it represents the classification method of a
 * certain entity type. For example, crowd is a taxonomic concept type, it is used to classify the
 * entity type of natural person, such as two conceptual instances of high income crowd and low
 * income crowd<br>
 * <br>
 * When creating a taxonomy concept type, it is required to relate an entity type {@link
 * ConceptTaxonomicConfig#taxonomicTypeIdentifier} for taxonomy, By default, system will add a
 * belongTo relation between the entity type and the taxonomy concept type；<br>
 * <br>
 * We can write a DSL rule on the concept instance of the taxonomy meta-concept, which is used to
 * indicate that the belongTo relation is only established when the instance of the classification
 * object satisfies the DSL rule, that is, the instance belongs to the current concept instance。
