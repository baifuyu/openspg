/**
 * The semantics defined on ontology<br>
 *
 * <p>There are not only properties or relations of portraits/facts between ontologies, but also
 * semantic connections, such as equivalence classes, parent-child classes, mutualOf or inverseOf
 * relations, and so on. These semantic relationships can be regarded as the consensus and axioms
 * that exist in reality. Under the SPG framework, we define ontology semantics ({@link
 * BaseSemantic}) to describe these consensus semantics.<br>
 * <br>
 * Ontology semantics can be divided into the following categories according to the different
 * objects of action：
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Represents the semantics between two schema types: such as inheritance semantics between
 *       two entity types, {@code <classA subClassOf classB>}
 *   <li>Represents the semantics between two instances: for example, the same semantics of two
 *       instances, {@code <instanceA sameAs instanceB>}
 *   <li>Represents the semantics between two properties: for example, property A is a standard
 *       property of property B，{@code <propertyA normalizedOf propertyB>}
 *   <li>Represents the semantics between two relations: such as reciprocal semantics between two
 *       relations, {@code <relationA inverseOf relationB>}
 * </ul>
