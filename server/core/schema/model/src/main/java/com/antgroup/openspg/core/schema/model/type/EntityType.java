/**
 * Class definition of the Entity. <br>
 *
 * <p>An entity refers to an objective instance that has significant business relevance, such as
 * users, enterprises, merchants, and so on. The entity type provides a definition for the specific
 * type of entity, which typically includes properties describing its characteristics and relations
 * with other entities. When defining entity types, it is essential to specify both the linking
 * operator and the fusing operator.
