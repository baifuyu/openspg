/**
 * RDF triple Class definition<br>
 *
 * <p>In RDF framework, all knowledge is represented by triples in the format of <subject,
 * predicate, object>. There are the following usage scenarios of representing knowledge using
 * triples:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Representing property: subject is generally an entity, concept or event. predicate is the
 *       name of property, object is literal constant or concept. For example, a knowledge such as
 *       the age of Jack is sixty years oldï¼Œit can be represented by <Jack, age, 60>;
 *   <li>Representing relation: the object is usually an entity, concept or event. For example, The
 *       founder of Alibaba is Jack Ma, it can be represented by: <Alibaba, funder, Jack>;
 * </ul>
