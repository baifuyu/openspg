/**
 * Class definition of literal constant. <br>
 *
 * <p>In the real world, the property values of some entities may be string constant„ÄÅnumbers or
 * other literals without specific semantics, For example, the name of a person is a text string
 * consisting of characters, and the thickness of a mobile phone is a numerical value that does not
 * carry any specific meaning by itself. <br>
 * In the SPG framework we define {@link BasicType} to represent literal constants. The difference
 * from other SPG types is that the {@link BasicType} is only used for the value type of entity
 * properties and cannot be used as a subject type to define SPO triples. The {@link BasicType} are
 * categorized into three situations:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Integer: used to describe integer values such as 1, 200, 9999 etc.
 *   <li>Float: Used to describe decimals values such as 0.021, -111.11 etc.
 *   <li>Text: Used to describe string or textual values such as "abc" and "alibaba" etc.
 * </ul>
