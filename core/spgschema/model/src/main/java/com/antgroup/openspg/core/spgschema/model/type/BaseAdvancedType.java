/**
 * The abstract parent class for higher-level types<br>
 *
 * <p>Unlike literal constants, entities in the real world typically possess their own properties or
 * relations that have semantic meaning and can be communicated. For instance, let's consider "Ant
 * Group" as a company. It has properties such as founders, places of registration, and relations
 * such as legal persons and employees. Another example is an Email Address, which is a text string
 * with a specific format. By using the schema type for Email Address, we can determine the pattern
 * of its property value and identify associated users of that Email Address.<br>
 * <br>
 * Advanced types have the following four implementations:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>standard type: {@link StandardType}
 *   <li>entity type: {@link EntityType}
 *   <li>concept type: {@link ConceptType}
 *   <li>event type: {@link EventType}
 * </ul>
