/**
 * This is the base class for Queries, aimed at providing an intermediate layer for users to
 * assemble query requests and achieve independence from the search engine. During the retrieval
 * process, the server will convert the Query into corresponding search engine-specific query
 * conditions, such as ES and Ha3.
 *
 * <p>Taking Elasticsearch and Ha3 search engines as examples, the following are examples of the
 * converted query strings:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Elasticsearch - GET spg_data/_search { "query": { "match": { "name": "alipay" } }, "from":
 *       1, "size": 10 }
 *   <li>Ha3 Search Engine - query=name:'alipay' &&config=cluster:spg_data,hit:10,start:0
 * </ul>
