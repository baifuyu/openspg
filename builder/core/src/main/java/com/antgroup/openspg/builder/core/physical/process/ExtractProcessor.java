/**
 * Knowledge extraction processor is used to extract unstructured text into structured information
 * can be achieved through extraction services or extraction rules.
 *
 * <p>Extraction services are often built based on machine learning and natural language processing
 * techniques. They automatically analyze text and extract key information. These services may
 * include entity recognition, relationship extraction, event extraction, and more. They leverage
 * contextual and semantic understanding to extract information from the text.
 *
 * <p>Extraction rules, on the other hand, rely on predefined rules and patterns to extract
 * information. By defining specific rules and patterns, it becomes possible to match certain
 * patterns in the text and extract the desired information. These rules can be designed based on
 * regular expressions, keyword matching, grammar rules, and other techniques.
 *
 * <p>Both extraction services and extraction rules aim to convert unstructured text into structured
 * information, enabling computers to understand and process the important content and relationships
 * within the text. This helps in organizing, searching, and analyzing textual data more
 * effectively, extracting valuable insights and information from it.
